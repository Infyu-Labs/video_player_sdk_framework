# üéÆ Video Player SDK for Unity (iOS)

This SDK bridges native Swift-based video playback functionality with Unity using P/Invoke, offering a seamless experience for playing, seeking, and controlling video content in your Unity applications.

## üì¶ Installation

- Clone the repo or drag the framework into your Xcode Unity project.
- Ensure the `.framework` is embedded & signed in the iOS target's **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** section.
- Enable Objective-C and C++ support if needed in Unity's iOS Build Settings.
- Link the framework using Unity‚Äôs `Plugins/iOS` folder structure.
- **Set the minimum deployment target to iOS 15.0** for the framework.

## üßπ Unity Integration

1. Create a C# MonoBehaviour Script (if not using the one provided).

2. Use the `VideoPlayerBridge.cs` in your Unity project:


## Usage Guidelines

### Mandatory Initialization

Before calling `Play()`, you **must** call `SetURLs()` with an array of valid video URLs. Failing to do so may cause a native crash.

Example in Unity MonoBehaviour:

```csharp
public class VideoPlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public string[] videoURLs;
    private VideoPlayerBridge playerBridge;

    void Start()
    {
        playerBridge = GetComponent<VideoPlayerBridge>();
        playerBridge.SetURLs(videoURLs);
        playerBridge.Play();
    }

    void OnApplicationQuit()
    {
        playerBridge.Cleanup();
    }
}
```

### Cleaning Up

Always call `Cleanup()` in `OnApplicationQuit()` to release native resources and prevent background playback.

### UI Control Visibility

You can show or hide the built-in UI controls dynamically via the following methods on `VideoPlayerBridge`:

| Method                 | Description                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| ShowForwardButton(bool) | Show or hide the forward button    |
| ShowBackwordButton(bool) | Show or hide the backward button   |
| ShowBack10Button(bool)  | Show or hide the back 10 seconds button |
| ShowFor10Button(bool)   | Show or hide the forward 10 seconds button |
| ShowPlayPauseButton(bool) | Show or hide the play/pause button |
| ShowBackButton(bool)    | Show or hide the back button       |
| ShowLogo(bool)          | Show or hide the logo              |
| ShowSeekbar(bool)       | Show or hide the seek bar          |
| ShowTimeDuration(bool)  | Show or hide the time duration display |

Example:

```csharp
playerBridge.ShowPlayPauseButton(true);
playerBridge.ShowSeekbar(false);
```


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Guidelines

- Set the video URLs using `SetURLs()` **before** calling `Play()`.
- Always call `Cleanup()` in `OnApplicationQuit()` to avoid background playback.
- Avoid calling `Play()` without setting URLs ‚Äî it may result in a native crash.

## üìû Example Swift Call (Optional)

If integrating on iOS directly, use:

```swift
Button("Play Video") {
    VideoPlayerService.shared.setURLS(urls: urls)
    VideoPlayerService.shared.play()
}
.onAppear {
    VideoPlayerService.shared.setShowFor10Button(true)
    VideoPlayerService.shared.setShowBack10Button(true)
}
```
